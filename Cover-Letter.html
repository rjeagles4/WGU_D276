	<p>Dear Bachelorette Casting Team,</p>
		
		
	<p id= "tab">I write to you today as a man and an <strong>unborn star</strong>. My name is Kraig, and I am ready to bring love, adventure, and chaos to your next season. If you're looking for a guy who can handle high-pressure situations, assemble IKEA furniture without shedding a tear, and survive in both the wild and <em>Call Of Duty</em>, look no further.
	</p>
	

	<p id= "tab">I'm an equal parts thrill-seeker, problem-solver, and romantic contender. Whether navigating the obstacles of love or the treacherous waters of IKEA instructions, I'm a man who gets the job done. The Bachelorette deserves someone who brings adventure, charm, and a slightly concerning amount of survival skills.
	</p>
	
	<p id= "tab">I'd love to show the world that true love can be found â€“ even while scaling tall buildings or preparing a bowl of mac & cheese. Let's make this season one to remember.
	</p>

	<p id= "tab">I am looking forward to our inevitable rose ceremony........
	</p>
